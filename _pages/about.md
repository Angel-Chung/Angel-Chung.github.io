I am a second year PhD student in [Operations, Information, and Decisions at Wharton School](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu), Universify of Pennsylvania (UPenn). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hamsa Bastani](https://hamsabastani.github.io). 

My research focuses on developing and deploying data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms and optimization for healthcare, education, and social good, particularly within marginalized contexts. 

I also have strong interest in the development of equitable AI system and ML fairness. I am passionate about working with practitioners and policymakers to transform socially impactful research into practical real-world solutions.
